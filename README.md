- 👋 Hi, I’m @GrantGuernsey
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis and machine learning, but I really just have a passion for coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, Python, and Visual Basic.
- 💞️ I’m looking for someone to help me learn machine learning, and computational tools for data analysis. I am also down to collaborate on any project.
- 📫 How to reach me guernsgd@mail.uc.edu is my school email and it is the best way to reach out to me.
